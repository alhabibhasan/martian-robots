## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Assuming you have nvm installed, run:

- `nvm use`

3. Then install dependencies using:

- `npm i`

4. Start the app using:

- `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Sample data to input into the react application:

```
5 3
1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL
0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL
```

## Running unit tests

Use `npm run test`

## Some limitations/future work/things I'd do if I had more time

- Input validation required, I didn't get a chance to add input validation but this is something I would address if I spent more time on this.
- More thorough set of test cases. If this was a real product, it would be helpful to go back to the product team with these changes to validate
  if it meets their use cases and if the brief was correctly understood. I'd do this sooner rather than later, before any PRs to land.
- Perhaps a better UI
